Today I have been working on my portfolio site.

I am using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create and manage it.

I have 2 goals. My plan for the end of the day is to add pages to the 'About Me' and 'CV', and for the end of the week I hope to have some more design on the page, as it currently looks a bit bland.
