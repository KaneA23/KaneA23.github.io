        <h1>Hi there, I'm Kane Adams</h1>
        <p>I am a Games Programming student currently finishing my postgraduate degree and looking for work for my
            summer placement to start in July.</p>
        <p>I mainly use C# in Unity where I have worked on a range of projects through my university course from mobile
            games, to using VR, to even experimenting with eye-tracking technololgy for both accessibility and immersion. I also have experience using C++ and
            Python and am interested to learn the Unreal Engine. I have an interest as a gameplay programmer.</p>
