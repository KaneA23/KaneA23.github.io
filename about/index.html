<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>
    My name is Kane and I am an undergraduate Computer Games Programming Student at University of Gloucestershire.
    Over the past 4 years I have worked with a range of languages as part of my education and jobs I've worked on.
    But my favourite language to work in is C# with the Unity game engine, along with that I have experience in C++ and want to learn to use it with the Unreal Engine 4 game engine.

    My name is Kane and I am a postgraduate games programming student at University of Gloucestershire.

<h2>My passion for video games</h2>
<p>
    Growing up, I enjoyed playing video games and would play a wide range of genres, with my favourite being Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) on the PlayStation 2. 
    This passion was what led to my interest in games development and wanting to know how games work. 
    Looking at how games work, I have an appreciation for the time developers have spent creating games and would love to continue in my career making games that can inspire others.
</p>
<p>
    I also enjoy building PCs for myself and others and have spent lots of time building, repairing, and upgrading computers, 
    spending a great length of time researching what parts are compatible and ensuring that these builds are able to live up to the ever-changing requirements that software (especially games) have.

<h2>Hobbies outside of Games</h2>
<p>Outside of gaming, I enjoy practicing Martial Arts.</p>
<p>
    I have dedicated my Saturday mornings to Shotokan Karate since 2008, 
    where by the time I was 16 I had achieved my 1st degree black belt and had come third in 2 regional tournament events: Individual Kata and Team Kumite.
    I am always pushing to improve myself, and when I am not preparing for a tournament or grading I have the responsibility to teach and help the lower grades to understand the art.
</p>
<p>
    Another Martial Art I practice is Taekwondo in the University society, where I am the president and on my way to achieve a black belt in the art as well.
    As president, I have the responsibilities of communicating with external instructors and other university societies, along with being in charge of setting up events for the society.
